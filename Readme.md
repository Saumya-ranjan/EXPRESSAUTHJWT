# JWT IMPLEMENTATION

## MVC ARCHITECTURE

Controllers: Logic Behind All the components or Object Being Used.

Models: Database Schema 

Views: Not Used Here --> Used for viewing website to User (Usually we won't use it as Headless Cms would be joined Directly to Trending Framework)

Middlewares Defined and Controlled from Routes to Auth the '/{anyRoutes}'.
